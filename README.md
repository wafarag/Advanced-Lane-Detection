# Advanced Lane Detection

<img src="output_images/test5_out.jpg" width="480" alt="Combined Image" />

In this project, my goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in images and videos using advanced computer vision techniques.

The goals / steps of this project can be summarized as follows: 

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
